### AIM: 
To write a program to create a player movement in unity.

### Algorithm:

2. Create the Moving Object
   - In the Hierarchy, right-click → 3D Object → Capsule (or Sphere).
   - Rename it to Player
3. Adding the Player Movement Behavior Script
   - Create the Script-In the Project Window, go to the Assets folder.
   - Right-click → Create → C# Script.
4. Write a script for player behavior and save it.
5. Attach the Script
   - Select player in the Hierarchy - Drag & Drop the playerBehavior script onto the Inspector Panel.
6. Run the game
7. Stop the program

### Program:
```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Player_movement : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    public float speed;
    void Start()
    {
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
       float xdir = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * speed;
      float zdir = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * speed;
      transform.position += new Vector3(xdir, zdir); 
    }
}
